The purpose of this post is to introduce some basic concepts from the reinforcement learning (RL) literature using the setting and notation that is familiar to economists studying infinite horizon dynamic decision problems. In particular, I make use of Rust (1987)'s bus engine replacement problem as a demonstrative example.
Note: the methods discussed here are mainly concerned with solving the dynamic problem, and not with estimation.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://rfaltings.github.io/research/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rfaltings.github.io/research/</guid><description>Working papers Non-Binding Agreements in Matching Markets: Evidence from Trucking (2024)

This paper examines the social welfare implications of such relational penalties in the trucking industry, using novel data from an online freight auction platform.</description></item></channel></rss>
