Online Appendix
Abstract: Sophisticated pricing algorithms used by digital transportation platforms have renewed interest in price control policies, but little evidence exists on their redistributive effects. This paper studies a uniform price mandate in the market for shared electric vehicle platforms in Washington, D.C., which prohibits origin- and destination-based pricing. To compute price equilibria encompassing hundreds of prices for specific origin-destination pairs, I develop a new simulation-based pricing algorithm, adapted from the reinforcement learning literature.</description></item><item><title>Other</title><link>https://rfaltings.github.io/other/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rfaltings.github.io/other/</guid><description>Honors I am a 2021 Twitch Research fellow

The purpose of this post is to introduce some basic concepts from the reinforcement learning (RL) literature using the setting and notation that is familiar to economists studying infinite horizon dynamic decision problems. In particular, I make use of Rust (1987)'s bus engine replacement problem as a demonstrative example.
Note: the methods discussed here are mainly concerned with solving the dynamic problem, and not with estimation.</description></item></channel></rss>
