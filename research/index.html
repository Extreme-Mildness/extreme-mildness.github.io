<p>Abstract: Price controls that seek to balance economic eﬀiciency with redistribution
between different groups of consumers have a long history of use in transporta-
tion policy. The emergence of modern platforms for transportation have re-
newed discussions of regulating prices, though little evidence exists on whether
they accomplish the goals of progressive redistribution. I study the market for
shared electric vehicle platforms in Washington D.C., where prices are man-
dated to be uniform across origin and destination. I first estimate a demand
system using high-frequency geolocation data from all firms in the market.
Using a novel reinforcement learning algorithm, I then compute counterfactual
equilibria in which platforms can freely set a sophisticated schedule of hundreds
of origin and destination specific prices. Comparing these to prices constrained
by the regulation, I find that the redistributive effects of the price controls
are mild, and mainly serve riders in the periphery of the city, which does not
correlate directly with income. Furthermore, I find that relaxing the regulation
increases rides taken by consumers by 41%, firm profits by 34%, and increases
consumer welfare by more than double the profit increase (80% of firm profits).</p>
